# FinViz-Screener
This script was written based on Adam Khoo's Stock Trading Course level 2 (Market Snapper) and his momentum stock trading strategy that he describes in the course. The intent was to automate the use of the free FinViz website so that you're able to easily import the identified stocks into your trading platform's watchlist for future screening.

# Prerequisite Requirements
